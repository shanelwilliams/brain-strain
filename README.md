# brain-strain
This was my final project while attending Kenzie Academy.
This is a trivia game that adds 1 point for correct answers and clears the score and restarts the game for an incorrect answer.

When I began this project I pseudo coded everything that I needed step by step. 
As I finished each step I moved the pseudo code to the top.
I had a bit of a struggle trying to get the random clues but received assistance from my teacher. 

Before I had begun my CSS I wanted it to be flashier but ended up having a bit of a time restraint.
So I researched different gradients when I found one that was similar to the one I ended up using. 
I played around with the colors and the degrees to find more of a softer look.
I researched different fonts on Google Fonts and found the two fonts that felt would be easy to read but also gave it more of the video game feel.

I wanted to add the category, questions, title, and the placeholder to HTML. I felt that it wasn't something that we used very often during class.
I added the 'Mind Blown' emoji to the title for an added effect and was similar to how I had felt after completing this project.

I really enjoyed having to use my brain and thinking outside the box.
